# Task-timer

Task-timer is a simple CLI tool to manage your tasks and track their time.
It will create a JSON file where all the data is stored in the location you specify in the init command.

It is a project in progress. Any feedback is welcome.

## Install

### Requirements
To install this application, you will need **Go 1.23.2 or higher**.  
You can download it from the [official Golang website](https://go.dev/dl/).
To verify your Go installation and version, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
go version
```

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeanMendez/time-tracker.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```bash
cd time-tracker
```
From here, you have two options to compile and install the application:

#### Option A: Install with Go
Use the go install command to compile and install the binary automatically in your *$GOPATH/bin* directory:
```bash
go install
```

**Note** - if *$GOPATH* is not defined on your system, look in the following locations:
- Unix systems: `$HOME/go`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\go`

#### Option B: Build with Task
Use [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) to compile the binary. Make sure you have Task installed before proceeding.
```bash
task build

```
This command will generate the binary at *./bin/time-tracker*.

If you want the binary to be accessible globally, you’ll need to add its path to your system’s PATH environment variable.

## Usage

### Init command
To start using the CLI you need to initialize the application by running 
```bash
timer-cli init [path]

This will create a *tasks.json* file in the specified path where all your tasks will be stored.

### Create command
Then you can create tasks by running 
```bash
timer-cli create [task name]
```
Creating a task doens't mean it is started.
You can also start a task by running the `start` command or when creating it by using the `--start` or `-s` flag.
```bash
timer-cli create [task name] --start
```

### Start command

```

or you can use the task ID
```bash
timer-cli list [task ID]
```

### Remove command

```

or you can use the task ID
```bash

```

### Stop command
